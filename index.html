Fun fact, I haven't changed this photo since I first added it during development of this website. I needed a test photo so I said "Fuck it!" and hastily took this on my phone. I kept thinking that later down the line I would get a professional photographer to get a decent photo of me in some kind of professional attire. Ha, my lazy ass could barely finish this website, and at that point I was too tired to work on anything else, let alone go through the hassle of finding some photographer, coughing up money for said photographer, and getting myself a nice outfit. Also, fuck you, I do look good in that tank top!</p>
